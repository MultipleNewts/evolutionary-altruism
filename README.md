# A Study of Evolutionary Altruism
This project is a simulated study of the factors that effect the evolution of altruism (aka co-operation).

The code present in this repository is the simulatory backing of the project, allowing features to be studied through digital simulation. The controlling variables can be modified to study their effect on the population. Furthermore, additions can be made to the code to add additional function for study.

The results of study can be found in an accompanying article, which is written in the overleaf LaTeX editor, by following this link: https://www.overleaf.com/read/rbjbcypjckhk#f6df71
